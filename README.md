🕹️ How to Play

* Use your mouse to move the basket left and right.

* Stars fall at random spots and speeds — so stay sharp!

✨ Cool Stuff You’ll See

* Real-time, smooth mouse controls
* Random star generation (with different colors and speeds)
* Live score and countdown timer
* Fun little score popups when you catch a star (+10 / -5)
* A final result screen with different feedback messages based on your performance
* Easy restart — just click and go again!

🛠️ Built With

* Python 3
* tkinter – for the visuals, mouse controls, and simple animations
* Custom game loop** using `after()` to control the timing and frame rate
